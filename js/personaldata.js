I have expertise in API development, database management, authentication, data processing to production environments and automated deployment. My passion is to simplify complex systems and ensure applications run stably in production. <br><br> Although my main focus is on the backend side, I have a deep interest in building intuitive and responsive user interfaces. I believe that a good user experience starts with a solid collaboration between the backend and frontend, so I often get involved in UI design discussions, optimize API structures for easier integration, and occasionally provide input on simple interface components to the frontend team. For me, UI is not just about the appearance, but also about how data and interactions are delivered smoothly to the user.";
